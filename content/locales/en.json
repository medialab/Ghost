Having directed two international exhibitions (Iconoclash 2002 and Making Things Public at the ZKM in Karlsruhe 2005), he found he had a taste for collective work and the exploration of new modes of research and presentation in what are called “the humanities”. In the jargon of research projects, he is the PI (“principal investigator”) of the AIME project, which means he has a hand in everything without knowing very much.",

It is thus an enormous opportunity for the project to benefit from not only from his keeping a watchful eye on the content but also on the project’s modus operandi.

We are calling our research data, roughly, any document that undergoes a trial at the point where two modes really clash; this is what we call “category errors”. This clash allows us to draw out a contrast that we were not aware of until then. Many are proposed in the book and in the notes, but the point of the collective inquiry is to bring them together. So each time that you present a situation (by way of a text, a film, a radio program), fully referenced (date, source, context, copyright), and which you think, according to your commentary, can move one of our questions forward (or displace the question in an even more interesting way), then this, for us, is data.

  "faq.ant.question.content":"Since the two projects have been running in parallel for over twenty-five years they obviously both have a great many connections. We have also maintained a kind of ‘software compatibility’ between the two projects. As a result, every research program that ‘runs’ on ANT should also ‘run’ on AIME! It is just that within the AIME project, the whole of the ANT approach becomes but one mode among many (it is called [NET] for ‘networks’). It is one of the two essential modes that render the inquiry feasible (the other being [PRE] for 'prepositions'). The difference in emphasis lies in the fact that ANT-based research relies on the question: ‘What is associated with what in the course of the inquiry?’ The multiplicity and surprises in the associations are the ‘truth conditions’ inherent to [NET]. However, such a description in no way stops the inquirer listening to other truth conditions for which the mere notion of ‘being associated’ is not enough. This is where the AIME project takes over but only after having first made an ANTish description.",

  "faq.scientists.question.content":"This question is not unique to scientists but to any practitioner to whom the AIME project addresses itself. In general, a description of scientific practice carried out along the lines of the sociology and history of science, should represent a welcome change for scientists whose activity is usually described in the most abstract terms by epistemology or in the most cynical terms by critics. On the whole, science studies have been met with approval when they describe research and with misgivings or even fury when they propose an alternative account of scientific activities. Scientists who enter the project must not be too thin-skinned nor should they feel too insecure about the objectivity of their science. This however, is where the diplomatic encounters are of course useful and tough. The reason why scientists should feel reassured is because most conflicts do not deal with science as a practice but with another mode of existence, called Double Click [DC], that has made these debates fruitless. We hope that by barring [DC] from entering into the discussion, scientists will feel more welcome especially as they are now attacked by other scientists (controversies) and no longer carry the same authority as before.",

  "faq.system.question.content":"Obviously, the project is systematic in the sense that it has been carried out for over twenty-five years and systematically pursued so that once a mode has been detected it is cross-referenced with all of the others modes. However, if by system it is meant that there are no other modes and that their description is complete, obviously AIME is not a system at all (compared to Hegel’s for instance) but firstly a recapitulation of certain ‘values’ most cherished by some of the informants interrogated by the author. This is to ensure that in the long run it is not transformed into a system but rather, that it has been conceived as an inquiry opened to many other co-inquirers other than the first one. On the whole, we think it is important that an inquiry into such an important topic as the anthropology of modernity be systematically pursued as each mode reacts to how another mode is understood. So, the postmodern obsession for avoiding systematicity at all costs, runs against the clarification that we wish to obtain.",

  "faq.entities.question.short": "Is AIME taking magic ...",
  "faq.entities.question.content": "The answer is definitely yes. It would be astonishing for an anthropological project not to take the invisible entities with which informants build their world very seriously. What is original about the AIME project is that it raises a set of questions that allow to the inquirer to define, for each claim to existence, the specifications of these entities. Thus, instead of a general division between the visible and invisible, the real and imagined, spiritual and material agents, a much larger gamut of possibilities of existence is envisaged, and as far as possible, precisely delineated. The expression ‘to take seriously’, when applied to these entities, is pushed to a new degree of precision because, contrary to all of the critical social sciences and much of ethnographic research, these specifications have to be ‘talked back to’ by those who are seriously engaged with them. In other words, the description by the AIME inquirers has to be proposed to the informants themselves. This is what makes the diplomatic encounters so interesting and risky.",

  "faq.power.question": "If AIME defines itself as a diplomatic enterprise, on behalf of which power are they sent?",
  "faq.power.question.short": "on behalf of which power ...",
  "faq.power.question.content": " The metaphor of diplomacy has been developed because there is no mediator above the parties doing the comparative anthropology. As long as there was the single Nature/multiple cultures paradigm, it is clear that mediator existed; an arbiter that could settle each dispute. This is why knowledge was the horizon of all possible anthropologies: ‘How do we know others?’ AIME is ‘sent’ on a ‘mission’ not just by knowledge but by diplomacy. That is, it states that there is no arbiter and asks the question: ‘Can we learn about and coexist with others?’ This is what opens up the possibility of a comparative anthropology understood as a negotiation of multiple ontologies. The ‘power’ that is represented in those encounters is probably the former Moderns who must now recognize that they have never been modern and that the Nature that they had imagined as a final arbiter is failing them, first as Knowledge, second as Gaia. However, the exact and variable shape of the parties in the negotiation is not defined in advance. So far, AIME is a peace proposal that comes after the disappearance of the state of war. It does not mean that diplomacy will really be happening.",

This is why we always use acronyms ([REP], [FIC], [REF]) to make it clear that what we designate by those letters are not to be taken as the domains, regions, substances or stable ontologies of reproduction, fiction, reference etc. There is no general solution to the problem of names. Usage only shows what a word means. The only rule that we followed was to avoid inventing technical jargon.",
