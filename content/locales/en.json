  "project.introduction.title":"How do we compose a common world?",
  "project.introduction.content":"Not so long ago, the project that would have seen modernization spread over the whole planet came up against unexpected opposition from the planet itself. Should we give up, deny the problem, or grit our teeth and hope for a miracle? Alternatively we could inquire into what this modern project has meant so as to find out how it can be begun again on a new footing.",
  "--": "--",
  "--": "--",
  "project.i-paragraph": "i paragraph",
  "project.i-paragraph.short": "modernization",
  "project.i-paragraph.content": "The inquiry in which you will be able to take part has the aim of providing a more precise definition for the experiences gathered under the vague expression “modernization”. And especially one that is more acceptable to those other civilisations that have also been subject to the same discovery: that there is no Earth where we can modernize “the way we used to”. So we have to think again what we mean by this term while both retaining the inheritance of the modernization project and composing it in a quite new way.",
  "project.ii-paragraph": "ii paragraph",
  "project.ii-paragraph.short": "values",
  "project.ii-paragraph.content": "The inquiry is based on the delicate extraction of a series of “values”—a deliberately outdated term—which the Moderns say they hold dear. But without ever being sure what these values mean, and how they can all be endorsed at the same time while respecting their differences and being wary of their tendency to crush other ones.",
  "project.iii-paragraph": "iii paragraph",
  "project.iii-paragraph.short": "crossings",
  "project.iii-paragraph.content": "To establish these differences, we have prepared a very simple little protocol that begins with the experience produced when there is a clash between two values. This clash is felt each time one value is judged using the instrumentation coming from another value. We will make a collection of such incidents by creating a database of what we will call “crossings” because they will allow two types of judgement to emerge.",
  "project.iv-paragraph": "iv paragraph",
  "project.iv-paragraph.short": "types of veridiction",
  "project.iv-paragraph.content": "The practice of gathering such documentation over time begins to produce the impression that it is possible, bit by bit, to distinguish types of incompatible truths. At first this seems, disconcertingly, to lead to full-on “relativism”. Except if one notices that each type of veridiction—the term permits the avoidance of the overloaded word “truth”—is the expression of an encounter with forms of existence that are very different from one another. The inquiry aims to set out the diversity of these different forms. This is why we are really dealing with an anthropology of the Moderns. We want to do for them what they did for other cultures. Except that it was quite difficult to understand the others in the absence of a description of ourselves that was in some small way realistic…",
  "project.v-paragraph": "v paragraph",
  "project.v-paragraph.short": "modes of existence",
  "project.v-paragraph.content": "It is these forms we are calling “modes of existence”, a banal label, but it has a special meaning here. When one speaks normally about the mode of existence of some group or individual, one refers to their customs, their mode of being, their ethology, their habitat in some way, their feeling for a place. In this inquiry, we are keeping all the connotations of the phrase, but we are giving the two terms “mode” and “existence” stronger meanings that don’t direct attention towards human groups or individuals, but towards the beings about which humans are interrogating themselves. The word “being” should not be unsettling: it is another way of replying to the question, “What, for example, is the law, or religion, or science?” “What is important to you?” and “How can I talk about this properly with you?\"",
  "project.vi-paragraph": "vi paragraph",
  "project.vi-paragraph.short": "inquiry",
  "project.vi-paragraph.content": "So far we have identified fifteen of these modes of existence. First, we would like to know if the values we have identified correspond, or not, to readers’ experiences. But then we would like to know if the account we have given of this is acceptable, and if it is not—which is very likely—how we can change it, and on the basis of what documents. Finally, we would like to know if it is possible to propose an alternative to the quite vague term “modernization”. <br/><br/> So, how will we proceed? By proposing three stages: that of the readers, that of the co-researchers, and that of the negotiators.",

  "phases.phase-one.content": "As with every inquiry, one has to be familiar, first of all, with the procedures. It looks complex at first. But in fact, it is very simple and doesn’t depend on any prior knowledge or jargon (though we have some technical terms). The difficulty comes of the fact that most experiences are not easy to follow because the Moderns have tried to squeeze them into boxes not made for them. We want to try to repair this faulty construction by offering you other signposts to follow and other accounts of these experiences. The easiest way to get used to the procedure is to start with the interim report either in hard copy or in the (identical) form that you can find on this site. The book is handy, but the digital version is “augmented” with a number of additions: first it is easily navigable, then there is a detailed glossary, numerous notes, to which are also added documents which are quite long in themselves. (The map of the site is explained here.) Then, once you have assimilated the questions we are asking ourselves, you can take them up in the composition of your own notebook. There is nothing stopping you from adding contribution on the body of available data.",

  "phases.phase-two.content": "So far we have been in a reading mode, a fairly classical way of getting to know material more deeply, with a bit of help from the digital. But what really interests us is the second stage. Thanks to the mediators who will publish your contributions, we want to shift the inquiry little by little away from its original framing. These mediators have the initial task of accompanying you in your exploration of the inquiry and inviting you to propose documents other than those available in the main text, in order to respond to the same questions. But we will very quickly notice that you will not just want to correct errors and comment on the statements made in the interim report, in other words offer a critique, but you will want to take up other questions as you formulate the problems in a quite different way. The digital environment has the aim of encouraging this progressive drift by multiplying the opportunities to rework documents and by recording these successive modifications. Then our inquiry will really have become collective.",

  "phases.phase-three.abstract": "how can we find the most <br/>acceptable account <br/>through a series of “diplomatic” negotiations?",
  "phases.phase-three.content": "This is the most unusual and riskiest part of the inquiry. The aim is not just to investigate by increasing the number of openings, as in the second stage, but to be able to come to some kind of provisional conclusions that will be a function of progress made between the “interim report” of 2012 and the status of the on-going questions that will have come to light in the process. The idea is not to publish an up-dated version of the initial book but to publish (in the form of pamphlets, web sites, and installations as the inquiry broadens and as the mediators make decisions) reports about the state of the art. The metaphor we use is that of diplomatic negotiations. This expression is often pejorative, but we take it very seriously because negotiations come into play when there is no common overarching principle that would allow for agreement. So the only solution is to set out as precisely as possible why the account given of such and such a value is shocking, admissible, compatible, or incompatible with some other account. At the end of two years we hope not to have found a solution, but to have advanced in the exploration of a proposition. To launch such negotiations, the mediators will invite a certain number of contributors and co-researchers to face-to-face meetings organised around the most thorny questions the inquiry has thrown up, those where the opposition between values and the accounts given of them is the most serious. The results of these meetings will then be archived in the digital environment of the AIME site, and will be subject to various responses. The aim, both ambitious and modest, will be to propose an alternative for the term “modernize”, one that is compatible with the expression “ecologize” and which we sum up with the term “composition”. Learning how to compose the common world, this is what is at stake.",

  "tools.report.short": "the hard-copy book",
  "tools.report.content": "The hard-copy book is fairly unusual. It is written in the form of a “research report” in which one finds summarised, in the most condensed and undemanding form possible, fieldwork studies which were impossible to print in their entirety. So the book appears without any notes or references. This is why, even if the book holds up by itself, it only really makes sense through the proofs and developments that will test it on the site. Proofs and developments which, in turn, will get their meaning through what the readers, turning into co-researchers, might well bring to them. The interim report has the aim of preparing readers, if they wish, to become co-researchers. It has three parts: how to make possible an anthropological inquiry on the Moderns by removing methodological obstacles; how to take advantage of the pluralism of modes of existence in order to carry out the inquiry while cutting one’s teeth on the modes which the Moderns were having difficulty dealing with; and finally how to profit from this inquiry so as to redefine the very notion of collective in a new way by revisiting the traditional terms of society and economy. To make the reading easier, we have arranged the multiple sub-titles at the beginning of each chapter, and gathered them in a very detailed table of contents that allows one to get an overview of the book in a few minutes.",

Whether you start with the hard-copy or the augmented version, you will find the same pages, chapters, sectional subtitles and the same detailed table of contents. With the augmented book you will obviously be able to enjoy a very powerful search function.</br></br>Why are we calling the digital book augmented? Because we have added three columns to it—on the right of the text—which vary in size and function according to your activities and content.</br></br>What are these columns?</br>The first column is the glossary (v for vocabulary). Although we have tried to avoid jargon, many common words take on particular meanings here and it will be useful to bear these in mind. In the printed book, these terms appear capitalized and in bold type. In the digital version of the book, these words link to glossary entries that further explain the word in question. To avoid cluttering up the text, we have marked these entries with a dot that you can click on if you want to find out more.</br></br>The second column contains information on documentation (d). A survey of this kind is based on diverse reading, lectures and fields of study. To make the paper book less forbidding, we have chosen to transfer all documentation - the so-called critical apparatus - to the digital environment. The entries in this column, which will be evolving constantly, are also marked with a dot. When you click the dot, the column expands and opens up to reveal references as well as pdf documents, photos or videos that expand the scope of what is usually referred to as a footnote. In addition, we have added galleries and have asked artists to participate in the investigation by means of more elaborate exhibitions. These interventions are intended to enable users to get as close as possible to the experiences that the text attempts to describe and which the collective inquiry will then elaborate upon and augment.</br></br>The third column is for contributions (c). This is a space for you to publish critiques, additional considerations and/or complementary or alternative documentation, based on your notes. Mediators will help you to find your way around and will moderate the contributions. Depending on the evolution of the site, your contributions may be transferred to the middle column.</br></br>Again, the challenging nature of this project means that functionalities will be added gradually and amended regularly.",

We seek to share the research experience and as such we are very open. However, we only do so according to very specific protocols and rather demanding expectations and as such, we remain very closed! If we dare to maintain this paradox it is only because experience is sharable and because the protocols that are so strictly adhered to render themselves a source of concern and open to debate. In the meantime, metalanguage becomes entirely ‘disposable’.<br/><br/>A contribution is a not a comment. It is not enough to simply ‘like’ or ‘not like’. Nor is it like editing a wiki or reviewing. A contribution works in such a way that it subjects the Inquiry to the trials for which it was designed.<br/>A contribution is an operation. It is a maneuver attempted during a diplomatic game. It is a practice that is both informed and free, operating within the intellectual machinery of the Inquiry. The co-inquirer can reformulate, complete and apply but he or she can also correct, test and protest. In every instance, it remains with the context of an empirical investigation.<br/>Inasmuch as it is possible each contribution should attempt to build upon something new and be in the form of an annotated document that develops an argument or line of thought. The role of the mediators is to direct the work behind the contribution towards those beings that are less well represented.<br/>The process of selecting contributions is performed with the mediators always keeping an eye towards the final phase of the Inquiry where the diplomatic operations and face-to-face rewriting sessions will take place. In this respect, the online platform serves as a kind of draft or preparatory document for these final meetings.",

We are calling our research data, roughly, any document that undergoes a trial at the point where two modes really clash; this is what we call “category errors”. This clash allows us to draw out a contrast that we were not aware of until then. Many are proposed in the book and in the notes, but the point of the collective inquiry is to bring them together. So each time that you present a situation (by way of a text, a film, a radio program), fully referenced (date, source, context, copyright), and which you think, according to your commentary, can move one of our questions forward (or displace the question in an even more interesting way), then this, for us, is data.

  "faq.ant.question.content":"Since the two projects have been running in parallel for over twenty-five years they obviously both have a great many connections. We have also maintained a kind of ‘software compatibility’ between the two projects. As a result, every research program that ‘runs’ on ANT should also ‘run’ on AIME! It is just that within the AIME project, the whole of the ANT approach becomes but one mode among many (it is called [NET] for ‘networks’). It is one of the two essential modes that render the inquiry feasible (the other being [PRE] for 'prepositions'). The difference in emphasis lies in the fact that ANT-based research relies on the question: ‘What is associated with what in the course of the inquiry?’ The multiplicity and surprises in the associations are the ‘truth conditions’ inherent to [NET]. However, such a description in no way stops the inquirer listening to other truth conditions for which the mere notion of ‘being associated’ is not enough. This is where the AIME project takes over but only after having first made an ANTish description.",

  "faq.scientists.question.content":"This question is not unique to scientists but to any practitioner to whom the AIME project addresses itself. In general, a description of scientific practice carried out along the lines of the sociology and history of science, should represent a welcome change for scientists whose activity is usually described in the most abstract terms by epistemology or in the most cynical terms by critics. On the whole, science studies have been met with approval when they describe research and with misgivings or even fury when they propose an alternative account of scientific activities. Scientists who enter the project must not be too thin-skinned nor should they feel too insecure about the objectivity of their science. This however, is where the diplomatic encounters are of course useful and tough. The reason why scientists should feel reassured is because most conflicts do not deal with science as a practice but with another mode of existence, called Double Click [DC], that has made these debates fruitless. We hope that by barring [DC] from entering into the discussion, scientists will feel more welcome especially as they are now attacked by other scientists (controversies) and no longer carry the same authority as before.",

  "faq.system.question.content":"Obviously, the project is systematic in the sense that it has been carried out for over twenty-five years and systematically pursued so that once a mode has been detected it is cross-referenced with all of the others modes. However, if by system it is meant that there are no other modes and that their description is complete, obviously AIME is not a system at all (compared to Hegel’s for instance) but firstly a recapitulation of certain ‘values’ most cherished by some of the informants interrogated by the author. This is to ensure that in the long run it is not transformed into a system but rather, that it has been conceived as an inquiry opened to many other co-inquirers other than the first one. On the whole, we think it is important that an inquiry into such an important topic as the anthropology of modernity be systematically pursued as each mode reacts to how another mode is understood. So, the postmodern obsession for avoiding systematicity at all costs, runs against the clarification that we wish to obtain.",

  "faq.entities.question.content": "The answer is definitely yes. It would be astonishing for an anthropological project not to take the invisible entities with which informants build their world very seriously. What is original about the AIME project is that it raises a set of questions that allow to the inquirer to define, for each claim to existence, the specifications of these entities. Thus, instead of a general division between the visible and invisible, the real and imagined, spiritual and material agents, a much larger gamut of possibilities of existence is envisaged, and as far as possible, precisely delineated. The expression ‘to take seriously’, when applied to these entities, is pushed to a new degree of precision because, contrary to all of the critical social sciences and much of ethnographic research, these specifications have to be ‘talked back to’ by those who are seriously engaged with them. In other words, the description by the AIME inquirers has to be proposed to the informants themselves. This is what makes the diplomatic encounters so interesting and risky.",

  "faq.power.question": "If AIME defines itself as a diplomatic enterprise, on behalf of which power are they sent?",
  "faq.power.question.short": "Diplomacy",
  "faq.power.question.content": " The metaphor of diplomacy has been developed because there is no mediator above the parties doing the comparative anthropology. As long as there was the single Nature/multiple cultures paradigm, it is clear that mediator existed; an arbiter that could settle each dispute. This is why knowledge was the horizon of all possible anthropologies: ‘How do we know others?’ AIME is ‘sent’ on a ‘mission’ not just by knowledge but by diplomacy. That is, it states that there is no arbiter and asks the question: ‘Can we learn about and coexist with others?’ This is what opens up the possibility of a comparative anthropology understood as a negotiation of multiple ontologies. The ‘power’ that is represented in those encounters is probably the former Moderns who must now recognize that they have never been modern and that the Nature that they had imagined as a final arbiter is failing them, first as Knowledge, second as Gaia. However, the exact and variable shape of the parties in the negotiation is not defined in advance. So far, AIME is a peace proposal that comes after the disappearance of the state of war. It does not mean that diplomacy will really be happening.",

This is why we always use acronyms ([REP], [FIC], [REF]) to make it clear that what we designate by those letters are not to be taken as the domains, regions, substances or stable ontologies of reproduction, fiction, reference etc. There is no general solution to the problem of names.
